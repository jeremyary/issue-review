# Persona definitions for broad appeal evaluation
# Each persona evaluates quickstarts from their PROFESSIONAL capacity only
# (not personal experiences like buying a car or taking out a personal loan)
#
# Goal: Identify quickstarts that are understandable and relevant to 
# non-technical audiences to ensure broad appeal in the catalog.
#
# Evaluation considers BOTH use case fit AND general concept value.
